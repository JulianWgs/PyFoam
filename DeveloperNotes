#+TITLE: How to contribute to PyFoam

* This document
* Used language
* Setup for development
  It is recommended to set up a "clean" environment for
  development. This makes sure that by accident no libraries are used
  that are "by accident" on the developer system but not present
  otherwise

  The following example assumes that you want to set up an environment
  for Python 3.6. First set up the virtual environment

: python3.6 -m venv venv36

  then activate it (this has to be done every time to work in this
  environment) with

: . ./venv36/bin/activate

  and install the requirements that =PyFoam= absolutely needs with

: pip install -r requirements.txt

  Lastly make sure that the current sources are used instead of a
  pre-installed =PyFoam= with

: . ./setDevelopmentPath.sh

  (this is sufficient if you want to use the current sources with the
  system-Python)

** Additional software
   To assist the development with
: pip install -r requirements_development.txt
   you can install additional libraries for unit-testing and
   documentation generation

   Additional software that is used by some parts of PyFoam can be installed with
: pip install -r requirements_additional.txt
